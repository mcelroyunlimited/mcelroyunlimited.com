    <h2>Why Invest?</h2>
    <p>December 2020. My hypothetical business endeavor is designing and installing geothermal power generators into peoples homes and businesses. What this means is there is a piping system underneath the ground that holds air, which is the temperature of the ground. Through weather changes, the difference in air and ground temperature is enough to generate a pressure difference and air flow, which can be harnessed as electrical energy through a a turbine.

The upfront costs of my company are pretty huge. Totaling around 2 million dollars. After filling out my cost sheet, I figured that most of the costs of my business were in the real estate, that is the warehouse. I went on Zillow and found a 22 thousand square foot building in Concord NH for $1.6 million. The second biggest cost was the employee salaries. Other than that there was expensive construction vehicles and equipment plus raw materials. 

To raise capital I will take out bank loans, my credit will have to be good, and I am realizing now that unless I make over 150k a year, a 2 million dollar loan is far out of reach. I could seek out co owners and split the loan 4 ways, making ourselves liable for 500k each. Im not sure this is the best way but I wont rely on angel investors or family money, my family hasn't inherited much. 

Convincing banks about my idea will be difficult, but I dont think it should seem all that foreign to them. My business is similar to general contracting, or solar installation. I may want to show how many interested clients I have, and an in depth business plan to show the bank loaners what I have in mind. The banks are going to be questioning their risk in loaning us around 2 million dollars. They will want to know how many customers I have, how much the equipment costs, how much my employees are to be paid, and If I have co-investors,they are going to want to know how reliable they are. 

The funds will straight to the manufacturing and installation of the geothermal units in peoples houses. Machines and trucks will have to be purchased quickly. My employees salaries will be the priority at first. As the CEO I would rather pay myself nothing and see the business grow in the early stages. Every project we do will become easier as we adjust and find shortcuts. Hopefully we can make our manufacturing efficient enough to leave empty space in our commercial building. With this open space I would like to sublet to another firm and earn back some mortgage money to make the building more affordable. </p>
